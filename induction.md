# Can ideas be plagiarised?

Looking at the Da Vinci Code case, where Dan Brown was accused by two authors, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, of "\[appropriating] the architechture" of their work, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982). Both works were published by Random House, so they were the target of a lawsuit from Baigent and Leigh.

*THBATHG* involved theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had child, whose bloodline continues today. Claims secret society protects heirs from conspiracies enacted by Catholic Church. *TDC* frames Holy Grail as documents showing Jesus and Mary Magdalene had children, which Vatican wants hidden.

2006-04-07: High Court judge dismissed claim. Said text comparison "did show some limited copying of the text" but this did not constitute copyright infringement (and was not the basis of the claim). "Even if the central themes were copied, they are too general or of too low a level of abstraction to be capable of protection by copyright law."

Random House: ruling "ensures that novelists remain free to draw in ideas and historical research".

2007-03-28 Lord Justice Mummery found that copyright law protects authors over research and composition of book, and manner in which ideas are expressed.

> "It does not, however, extend to clothing information, facts, ideas, theories and themes with exclusive property rights, so as to enable the claimants to monopolise historical research or knowledge and prevent the legitimate use of historical and biographical material, theories propounded, general arguments deployed, or general hypotheses suggested (whether they are sound or not) or general themes written about."

Baigent and Leigh: "We believed, and still do, that non-fiction authors would suffer and be discouraged from extensive research if it was found that any author could take another's ideas, 'morph' and repackage them and sell them on."
